#### 03/02/23 first attempt ####
# I decided to study the NDVI of the Po Valley, a highly cultivated area, to assess how NDVI varies over months and years as t° changes
# using sentinel2 data

#### study area ####
# the study area under consideration is the padana plain with particular focus on the area south of Parma 
# To get the shp of the study area I converted a tiff image of the Po Valley to shp using Qgis
# link tiff file https://www.esa.int/Space_in_Member_States/Italy/Immagine_EO_della_Settimana_Pianura_Padana

#  First of all we need to install addictional packages usefull to run my project with the function install.packages
# packages usefull are "tidyr", "rgdal"* , "ggplot2"*, "terra"*, "leaflet", "rasterVis", "gridExtra"* , "RColorBrewer", "plotly"
# * = already imported in R during the lessons 

#### tidyr package #####
# tidyr package : Tidy Messy Data Tools to help to create tidy data, 
# where each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value
# link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html

#### rgdal package ####
# rgdal package: Bindings for the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library 
# Provides bindings to the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library ('GDAL') (>= 1.11.4) 
# and access to projection/transformation operations from the 'PROJ' library. 
# link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html

#### ggplot2 package ####
# ggplot2 package: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics
# A system for 'declaratively' creating graphics, based on "The Grammar of Graphics". 
# You provide the data, tell 'ggplot2' how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.
# link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html

#### terra package ####
# terra package: Spatial Data Analysis
# Methods for spatial data analysis with vector (points, lines, polygons) and raster (grid) data.
# link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html

#### leaflet package ####
# leaflet package: Create Interactive Web Maps with the JavaScript 'Leaflet' Library
# Create and customize interactive maps using the 'Leaflet' JavaScript library and the 'htmlwidgets' package
# link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/index.html

#### rasterVis package #### 
# rasterVis package: Visualization Methods for Raster Data
# Methods for enhanced visualization and interaction with raster data
# link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rasterVis/index.html

#### gridExtra package ####
# gridExtra package: Miscellaneous Functions for "Grid" Graphics
# Provides a number of user-level functions to work with "grid" graphics, notably to arrange multiple grid-based plots on a page, and draw tables.
# link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html

#### RColorBrewer package ####
# RColorBrewer package: ColorBrewer Palettes
# Provides color schemes for maps (and other graphics) designed by Cynthia Brewer as described at http://colorbrewer2.org.
# similar to ColorRampPalette used during the lessons
# link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html

#### plotly package ####
# plotly package Create Interactive Web Graphics via 'plotly.js'
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/index.html
